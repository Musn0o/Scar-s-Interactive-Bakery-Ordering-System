# Scar's Interactive Bakery Ordering System

This project is an interactive bakery ordering system that uses a conversational AI to take customer orders. The system is built with Python and utilizes the LangChain and Google Generative AI libraries to create a chatbot that can understand and process customer requests.

## Description

The Scar's Interactive Bakery Ordering System is a sophisticated application designed to streamline the customer ordering experience. It features a friendly AI-powered waiter who can engage in natural conversations with customers, answer questions about the menu, and efficiently process orders. The system also includes an administrator module for managing the bakery's database, including menu items, operating hours, and customer information.

## Features

- **Conversational AI Waiter**: A friendly chatbot that can take customer orders, answer questions, and provide a personalized experience.
